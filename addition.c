/*
 * Function: addition
 * -------------------
 * Performs addition of two numbers represented as doubly linked lists.
 *
 * Each digit of the number is stored in a node of the doubly linked list.
 * The least significant digit is at the tail, and the most significant digit
 * is at the head.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   head1, tail1 - pointers to the head and tail of the first number
 *   head2, tail2 - pointers to the head and tail of the second number
 *   headR, tailR - pointers to the head and tail of the result number
 *
 * Returns:
 *   SUCCESS if addition was performed correctly,
 *   FAILURE if input lists are NULL or insertion into result fails.
